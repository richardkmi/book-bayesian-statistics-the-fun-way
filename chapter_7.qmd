# Bayes' Theorem with LEGO

## Questions

### Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that a relative who just moved to a county in the Kansas City metropolitan area also lives in a county in Kansas. 

-   Kansas City, despite its name, sits on the border of two US states: Missouri and Kansas

-   The Kansas City metropolitan area consists of 15 counties, 9 in Missouri and 6 in Kansas.

-   The entire state of Kansas has 105 counties and Missouri has 114.

    ### 

$$
P(Kansas | Kansas City) = \frac{P(Kansas) \times P(Kansas City| Kansas)}{P(Kansas City)} \\
= \frac{\frac{6}{105} \times \frac{105}{219}}{\frac{15}{219}} = \frac{2}{5}
$$

### A deck of cards has 52 cards with suits that are either red or black. There are four aces in a deck of cards: two red and two black. You remove a red ace from the deck and shuffle the cards. Your friend pulls a black card. What is the probability that it is an ace?

$$
P(\text{ace |}\text{ black card}) = \frac{P(\text{black card |}\text{ ace)}\times P(ace)}{P(\text{black card})}\\
= \frac{\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{51}}{\frac{26}{51}} = \frac{1}{13}
$$
