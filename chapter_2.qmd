## Questions

### What is the probability of rolling two six-sided dice and getting a value greater than 7?

```{python}
from sympy import *

x, y = symbols('x y')
event = (x + y) > 7
sample_space = [(i, j) for i in range(1, 7) for j in range(1, 7)]
prob = len([roll for roll in sample_space if event.subs({x: roll[0], y: roll[1]})]) / len(sample_space)

print(f"{round(prob,4) * 100}%")
```

### What is the probability of rolling three six-sided dice and getting a value greater than 7?

```{python}
x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
event = (x + y + z) > 7
sample_space = [(i, j, k) for i in range(1, 7) for j in range(1, 7) for k in range(1, 7)]

prob = len([roll for roll in sample_space if event.subs({x: roll[0], y: roll[1], z: roll[2]})]) / len(sample_space)

print(f"{round(prob,4) * 100}%")
```

### The Yankees are playing the Red Sox. You're a diehard Sox fan and bet your friend they'll win the game. You'll pay your friend \$30 if the Sox lose and your friend will have to pay you only \$5 if the Sox win. What is the probability you have intuitively assigned to the belief that the Red Sox will win?

> $O(\text{Red Sox win}) = \frac{30}{5} = 6$

> $P(\text{Red Sox win}) = \frac{O(\text{Red Sox win})}{1 + O(\text{Red Sox win})} = \text{86\%}$

> $O(\text{Red Sox win}) = \frac{.86}{1-.86} = \approx{6}$
