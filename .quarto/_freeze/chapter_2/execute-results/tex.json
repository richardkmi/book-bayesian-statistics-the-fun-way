The Yankees are playing the Red Sox. You're a diehard Sox fan and bet your friend they'll win the game. You'll pay your friend \\$30 if the Sox lose and your friend will have to pay you only \\$5 if the Sox win. What is the probability you have intuitively assigned to the belief that the Red Sox will win?\n\n> $O(\\text{Red Sox win}) = \\frac{30}{5} = 6$\n\n> $P(\\text{Red Sox win}) = \\frac{O(\\text{Red Sox win})}{1 + O(\\text{Red Sox win})} = \\text{86\\%}$\n\n> $O(\\text{Red Sox win}) = \\frac{.86}{1-.86} = \\approx{6}$\n\n",
